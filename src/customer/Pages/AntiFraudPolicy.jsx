Your case will be accepted by VideshApna based on the information you have provided, which we assume is to be true. VideshApna is not liable if you have provided incorrect / misleading / fraudulent documentation or information.</p>
<p className="text-lg text-gray-500 ">VideshApna does not provide documentation or any assistance in visa processing. We assume that required documents submitted to us is 100% true and correct.</p>

<p className="text-lg text-gray-500 ">To avoid being duped and refused entry into foreign countries, you should bear in mind the following:</p>
<ul className="pl-5 mt-3 mb-3">
    <li className="text-lg text-gray-500" style={{listStyle:"disc"}}>Do not be misled by dishonest VideshApna staff into believing that it is acceptable practice to submit forged documents with your application. The application will be refused and you may face further investigation from Indian authorities. Please keep in mind that VideshApna does not do any documentation or visa processing for any candidates.</li>
    <li className="text-lg text-gray-500" style={{listStyle:"disc"}}>Do not believe VideshApna staff who say that they can, in exchange for money or other favors, influence the processing speed of applications or the final decision. They cannot. Visa decisions are made only by visa officers authorized by the respective country.</li>
    <li className="text-lg text-gray-500" style={{listStyle:"disc"}}>Do not be fooled by imposters pretending to be visa officers from Embassies. Legitimate visa officers do not meet applicants outside their official place of work nor do they contact you to request for money.</li>
    <li className="text-lg text-gray-500" style={{listStyle:"disc"}}>Do not be fooled by fake websites designed to look like official government websites or like service delivery partner websites. Always get your visa information from official government websites.</li>
    <li className="text-lg text-gray-500" style={{listStyle:"disc"}}>Do not be duped by a job or visa scam. Many people are being cheated with overseas job# offers that do not exist. Please deliberate your decision before you hand over your money, passport, and personal details. Note: If the job offer sounds too good to be true, it could be a scam.</li>
</ul>
<p className="text-lg text-gray-500 ">Crooked staff often advises applicants to provide fake documentation or enter into any arrangements of convenience. Please don&rsquo;t be fooled. Your investment will be lost. In addition, you will be caught and you may be denied entry to the country you have applied to.</p>
<p className="text-lg text-gray-500 ">USA, UK, Australia &amp; Canada welcome genuine visitors, students, and work immigrants. Immigration agencies in these countries will not tolerate any abuse to the immigration system and have a zero tolerance towards fraud. Immigration Authorities have very effective methods for detecting fraud and work with international partners and Indian authorities also do follow the same. When they uncover fraud, including false education and language certificates, the visa will be refused and the applicant may face a ten-year visa ban as well as possible action by the Indian authorities.</p>
<p className="text-lg text-gray-500 ">Fraud is a criminal offense in USA, Australia, Canada and the UK, and can lead to severe penalties for those involved. But ultimately the responsibility for a visa application lies with the applicant. Providing fraudulent documents or misleading information can result in severe consequences not just for the staff but also the applicant. Applicants need to protect themselves from immigration fraud by being aware of the ways people may try to take advantage of them and their situation.</p>
<p className="text-lg text-gray-500 ">VideshApna Management strongly advises you against indulging in any kind of fraud or misrepresentation of your profile.</p>
<p className="text-lg text-gray-500 ">Please be warned that submission of fraudulent documentation to a visa issuing authority will result in you being banned from the country for no less than 10 years.</p>
